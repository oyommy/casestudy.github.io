## Project Overview

## Project 1: UX Writing - Microcopy Audit
Review microcopy and improve where necessary

### Objectives
- Check UI texts for clarity and consistency
- Review all error messages: Must state the problem and tell users what to do
- Check if tone and voice are suitable for the intended audience 
- Check for tooltips where necessary
- Check for jargon

---

## 🪄 Business Problems

- Error messages were vague (‘Action cannot be completed, please raise a ticket to XYZ team’).
- Users didn’t know what action to take when they run into issues
- Customer support flagged this as a top frustration
- Microcopy was misleading: View/Edit when you can only view


---

## My Approach

- Took it upon myself to revamp the miccrocopy
- Asked to see the tickets raised 
- Created a mini microcopy style guide
- Collaborated with BAs and UX Designers
- Conducted A/B tests

Maybe bring objectives back here


## Results
- Introduced placeholders
- Rewrote microcopy
- Rewrote error messages
- Empathy 
- Do not blame the user
- Specific and actionable error messages
- Avoided blaming the user for anything
- Provided a solution
